# Cookie Management Implementation

## Overview

The cookie management system has been fully implemented to solve the LinkedIn reCAPTCHA issue by persisting login sessions.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/scraper.py`
- Added `CookieManager` import and initialization
- Implemented cookie loading before login attempt
- Added cookie saving after successful login
- Proper error handling for cookie operations

### 2. `src/cookie_manager.py` (Already Created)
- Manages saving and loading of LinkedIn cookies
- Provides methods for cookie persistence

## How It Works

### First Run (Manual Login Required)
1. Script starts with no cookies
2. Script enters credentials automatically
3. LinkedIn shows security verification page
4. **YOU MUST MANUALLY COMPLETE THE VERIFICATION IN THE BROWSER**:
   - Wait for the script to timeout and show the prompt
   - In the browser window, complete any security check (answer question, verify identity, etc.)
   - Once you're logged in (you see the LinkedIn feed), the script detects it
5. Cookies are saved to `linkedin_cookies.json`
6. Session continues normally

### Subsequent Runs
1. Script loads saved cookies from `linkedin_cookies.json`
2. Adds cookies to browser context
3. Navigates to LinkedIn feed
4. If cookies are valid, bypasses login completely
5. If cookies expired, falls back to normal login

## Key Implementation Details

### Cookie Loading (Lines 213-238 in scraper.py)
```python
# Try to load existing cookies for persistent login
saved_cookies = cookie_manager.load_cookies()
if saved_cookies:
    try:
        context.add_cookies(saved_cookies)
        page.goto("https://www.linkedin.com/feed/", timeout=config.TIMEOUTS["login"])
        time.sleep(3)  # Give page time to load
        
        current_url = page.url
        if "/feed" in current_url or "/in/" in current_url:
            skip_login = True  # Successfully logged in with cookies
```

### Cookie Saving (Lines 431-439 in scraper.py)
```python
# Save cookies after successful login
if login_detected:
    try:
        cookies = context.cookies()
        # Convert to dict if needed
        cookies_dict = [dict(c) for c in cookies]
        cookie_manager.save_cookies(cookies_dict)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to save cookies: {e}")
```

## Benefits

- ✅ No more reCAPTCHA failures (after first manual login)
- ✅ Faster startup (skips login entirely)
- ✅ More reliable automation
- ✅ Simulates "stay logged in" behavior

## Security Notes

- Cookies file contains your LinkedIn session token
- Keep `linkedin_cookies.json` secure
- Never commit cookies to version control
- Delete cookies file if account is compromised

## Troubleshooting

### Cookies Not Working
1. Delete `linkedin_cookies.json`
2. Run script again
3. Complete manual login
4. Cookies will be regenerated

### Session Expired
- Script automatically falls back to normal login
- New cookies will be saved after successful login

## File Locations

- Cookie file: `resume-gen-auto-applier/linkedin_cookies.json`
- Manager: `src/cookie_manager.py`
- Integration: `src/scraper.py` (lines 213-238, 431-439)
